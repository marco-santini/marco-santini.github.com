Over the years I have always looked for the time to take care of small personal projects. My problem has always been organizing some notes as I progress in my work. Recently I had the need to manage these &amp;ldquo;experiments&amp;rdquo; for longer periods of time and so, obviously, things got complicated having to rely only on my memory. What better occasion then to change approach and create a personal blog?</description></item></channel></rss>
